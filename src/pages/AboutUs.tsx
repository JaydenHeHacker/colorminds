              <p>
                Color Minds was born from a simple observation: coloring isn't just for kids. Adults around the world have rediscovered the therapeutic benefits of coloring‚Äîreducing stress, improving focus, and providing a creative outlet in our busy digital lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                We started with a collection of hand-curated coloring pages, carefully selected for their quality and variety. As our community grew, we listened to feedback and realized that people wanted more‚Äîmore variety, more personalization, and more ways to express their creativity.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when we integrated AI technology. Now, our platform offers both curated collections and the ability to create custom coloring pages on demand. Whether you're looking for a specific theme, want to turn a family photo into a coloring page, or need a series of connected images for a special project, Color Minds has you covered.
